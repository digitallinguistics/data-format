    <p>There are many ways a linguist could potentially represent their data in digital form, with choices between a variety of formats (a relational database, XML, a tabular spreadsheet, JSON, etc.), as well as which properties to include and what to call them (e.g. does a text have a ‘language’ property, and should it be written as <code>"lang"</code> or <code>"language"</code>?).</p>
    <p>Digital Linguistics recommends a data format called <dfn title=JSON><abbr title='JavaScript Object Notation'><a href=http://json.org target=_blank>JSON</a></abbr></dfn> (JavaScript Object Notation). Using this format, we have designed the schema below to capture hierarchical linguistic data in a way that aligns with the descriptive categories that linguists use, relying on fundamental linguistic notions such as <dfn>text</dfn>, <dfn>morpheme</dfn>, <dfn>orthography</dfn>, etc. For instance, this schema is capable of capturing the fact that a text contains sentences, sentences contain words, words contains morphemes, and morphemes contain phonemes. This turns out to be a crucial factor in inputting, editing, searching, and analyzing linguistic data.</p>
    <p>JSON has become the data interchange format for the web, and is supported by every major programming language. Even better, it’s extremely easy for humans to read. Below is a short phrase represented in JSON format. Notice that, even without understanding how the format works, you can see the hierarchical relationship between phrases, words, and morphemes, and you know which piece of data belongs to what.</p>

<code class=example>{
  "transcription": "Hola, me llamo Patricio.",
  "translation": "Hello, my name is Patrick."
  "words": [
    {
      "token": "Hola",
      "morphemes": [
        {
          "token": "hola",
          "gloss": "hello"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "token": "me",
      "morphemes": [
        {
          "token": "me",
          "gloss": "1sg.OBJ"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "token": "llamo",
      "morphemes": [
        {
          "token": "llam-",
          "gloss": "call"
        },
        {
          "token": "-o",
          "gloss": "1sg.PRES.IND"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "token": "Patricio",
      "morphemes": [
        {
          "token": "Patricio",
          "gloss": "Patrick"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

    <p>JSON is incredibly easy to learn. It consists of just a few simple rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All data in JSON is represented as either an <dfn>object</dfn> (represented by curly braces <code>{}</code>), or a <dfn>collection</dfn> of objects (also called an <dfn>array</dfn>, represented by square brackets <code>[]</code>).</li>
      <li>Objects represent a single instance of a type of data. Objects contain a list of <dfn>properties</dfn> (also called <dfn>attributes</dfn> or <dfn>fields</dfn>) and their <dfn>values</dfn>, both placed in double quotes <code>""</code> and separated by a colon <code>:</code>. Pairs of properties and their values are separated by commas <code>,</code>. The example on the left shows an object representing a single phrase. This phrase has a property called <code>"transcription"</code>, and the value for that property is <code>"Hola, me llamo Patricio."</code>.</li>
      <li>Arrays are a collection of items, separated by commas <code>,</code>. Those items can be strings of text <code>""</code>, numbers <code>#</code>, even JSON objects <code>{}</code> and other arrays <code>[]</code>. In the example on the left, the phrase has a collection called <code>"words"</code> containing a list of all the word objects in the phrase. Notice each word also has a collection called <code>"morphemes"</code>. This nesting of arrays and objects allows us to capture the hierarchical nature of linguistic data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another great feature of JSON is that adding new properties to an object doesn’t change or in any way disrupt its other properties. This allows you to take your data from tool to tool without any tedious conversion or formatting. For example, say you’ve transcribed your data using a tool for morphological analysis, and now you want to add time alignment to each phrase using a different tool. If you were using FLEx and ELAN, you would have to first export from FLEx and create an ELAN file. In other words, you have to change the data <em>format</em> just to change the type of annotation you want to add. But with JSON, adding time alignment data couldn’t be simpler. The time alignmemt tool would merely need to add properties for <code>"startTime"</code> and <code>"endTime"</code> to the phrase, and enter their values. You could then take your data back to the morphological analysis tool without any converting, because the data hasn’t been altered, just extended. The underlying format is all the same.</p>

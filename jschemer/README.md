# JSchemer
A simple utility for generating clean HTML from JSON Schema data.

## Install
`npm install --save jschemer`

## Usage
`const jschemer = require('jschemer')`;

## API
The JSchemer exposes a single method, `convert`, which takes the JSON Schema data as its single argument, in either JSON or string format. `convert` returns a string containing the generated HTML. The returned HTML consists of a single `<section></section>`, not an entire HTML page.

## CSS
JSchemer comes with a default CSS file, `jschemer.css`, which you can link into your generated HTML document. You can easily customize this file, or edit its source, `jschemer.less`, and use LESS to regenerate the CSS. The HTML generated by JSchemer is also designed to be easy to style: each type of object and property is given an easily-identifiable class, such as `array` or `description`, so that you can create your own stylesheet using these classes.

## Notes
* JSchemer assumes your JSON data is valid according to v4 of the JSON Schema specification. You should validate your JSON Schema data before running JSchemer.

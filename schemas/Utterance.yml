title:   Utterance
type:    object

description: 'The term *utterance* is intentionally ambiguous, and refers to any unit of a text above the word level. The DLx framework imposes no requirements regarding this size of this unit or how segmentation of the text into units should be accomplished. The user may choose to segment a text based on prosodic units, turns, sentences, or any other appropriate subdivision.'

        - judgement
      description: A judgement of the grammaticality or acceptability of the utterance. Some linguists distinguish between grammaticality and acceptability, such that some utterances may be considered grammatical but not acceptable. Unacceptable utterances are typically those which are semantically or pragmatically odd in context. It is strongly recommended that a note be included with each judgement, and the source of the judgement indicated in the note.

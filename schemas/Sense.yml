title:   Sense
type:    object

description: A *sense* is one of the possible meanings of a lexical item. For example, the lexeme *run* has many different senses, such as as 'run in a race' and 'run water in a sink'. It is up to the linguist to decide whether two particular uses of a lexeme count as the same sense or different senses.

    description: If the current lexeme is an affix or other grammatical morpheme, this field should be used to describe the category that the morpheme attaches to, optionally in multiple languages. If a lexical item can attach to multiple base categories, you should list them as separate senses. This field should generally (but not obligatorily) be used in tandem with the `derivedCategory` property.

#   semanticClass:

Common uses might be `animate`, `standing`, etc. This field is especially useful when the semantic class of a word conditions agreement on some other word (for example, if different semantic categories of nouns trigger different types of verbal agreement). If this class affects the morphosyntactic behavior of the item, use the Sense.category property instead. The semanticClass property is for purely semantic classification. Note that the semanticClass field is different from the semanticDomains field. A word may be a member of a semantic domain (for example, "body parts"), but its membership in that domain might have no effect on its morphosyntactic behavior or its semantic interpretation (if for example the grammar of the language does not treat body parts in any special way).

For example, sometimes two speakers may use the same word with a slightly different set of senses. In American English, for instance, *Coke* is a specific brand of soda for most speakers, but a generic term for soda for other speakers. The generic sense would therefore be listed as a dialectal variant of the specific sense.

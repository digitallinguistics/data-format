title:   Sense
type:    object

description: A *sense* is one of the possible meanings of a lexical item. For example, the lexeme *run* has many different senses, such as as 'run in a race' and 'run water in a sink'. It is up to the linguist to decide whether two particular uses of a lexeme count as the same sense or different senses.

    title:       Argument Structure

  baseCategory:
    title:       Base Category
    $ref:        https://schemas.digitallinguistics.io/Category.json
    description: If the current lexeme is an affix or other grammatical morpheme, this field should be used to describe the category that the morpheme attaches to, optionally in multiple languages. If a lexical item can attach to multiple base categories, you should list them as separate senses. This field should generally (but not obligatorily) be used in tandem with the `derivedCategory` property.

    description: The lexical category, part of speech, or morphosyntactic class for this Lexeme, optionally in multiple languages. If the current lexeme is an affix or other grammatical morpheme where a `category` property doesn't always make sense, this property may be omitted.

      type:        object
      description: >
        A cross reference to another sense. A cross reference object has two properties: `relation`, and either `members` or `sense`. The `relation` property indicates the type of lexical relation, while the `sense` or `members` properties point to the referenced senses.

          description: For enumerated/open sets, this property specifies the members of the set of lexical items. The current lexical item may also be included in the set. Required for enumerated/open sets. For enumerated sets, `members` must be an object. For open sets, `members` must be an array.

            - type:        object
              description: If the lexical relation type is an enumerated set, `members` should be an object whose keys are arbitrary strings representing each role within the enumerated set, and whose values are Database References to Lexemes. For example, when creating an enumerated set of senses for polar adjectives, the keys in this object might be "positive" and "negative", and the values of each of these would be references to the positive and negative senses, respectively.

  semanticClass:
    title:       Semantic Class
    $ref:        https://schemas.digitallinguistics.io/Category.json
    description: The semantic class of this sense. Note that this field is different than the broader Semantic Domains (`semanticDomains`) field. A word may be a member of a semantic domain (for example, "body parts"), but its membership in that domain might have no effect on its morphosyntactic behavior or its semantic interpretation (if for example the grammar of the language does not treat body parts in any special way). The `semanticClass` field should be used when the semantic class of the lexical item conditions the morphosyntactic behavior of other items. It is especially useful when that semantic class is not overtly marked on the form. For example, some languages have noun classes that are lexically specified and that don't always have overt expression on the noun, but which nonetheless condition agreement on verbs or adjectives. If the semantic class of the item conditions its *own* morphosyntactic behavior rather than just the behavior of surrounding items, you may want to use the `inflectionClass` or `category` properties instead of, or in addition to, the `semanticClass` property.

  semanticDomains:
    title:       Semantic Domains
    type:        array
    uniqueItems: true
    description: A list of the semantic domains this sense belongs to. Examples include color, body part, clothing, etc. Each semantic domain is a Category object.

  usages:
    title:       Usages
    type:        array
    uniqueItems: true
    description: A set of information about the social contexts where this sense is used. Common values might include regions, registers, dialects, or particular social groups. Note that, unlike Forms and Lexemes, Senses do not have `variants` of `variantOf` fields. Information of this type should be captured by the `usages` field instead. For example, some American English speakers use the word *coke* as a generic term for a carbonated drink, while others use it only as the specific name of a product. Rather than listing one sense as a variant of another (thereby privileging one meaning as primary), specify additional usage information for one or both senses indicating who uses that sense and in what situations.

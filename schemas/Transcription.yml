description: 'A transcription of a piece of data in a language, optionally in multiple orthographies. For example, a transcription might be written in both a practical orthography and IPA. Each key is the abbreviation / short name for an orthography, and the value for that key is the transcription of the data in that particular orthography. The abbreviation / short names for the orthographies may be any string, but it is recommended to keep them short and to use only ASCII characters. In the DLx infrastructure, the keys are whatever is provided in the `key` field of the Language.'

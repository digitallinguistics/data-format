For example, if a language distinguishes between a palatalized `/t/` and a plain `/t/`, the first should include the feature `palatalized` and the second `plain` (or no features). Note that most features are also a manner of articulation as well, so it up to the linguist to decide when a given phonetic detail is a manner, or when it is a feature (i.e. a diacritic). For example, a language might distinguish phonemically between a palatal plosive `/c/` and a palatalized plosive `/tʲ/`. The first would list `palatal` as its place of articulation, while the second would list `palatalized` as a distinctive feature. Do not include features here if they are already used for manner, unless your analysis is that this feature is *both* a manner and a feature of this phoneme, e.g. a palatalized palatal stop. This field is used primarily for consonants, but may also apply to vowels as well (e.g. the `close` and `open` features).",

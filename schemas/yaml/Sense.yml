type:    object

description: A *sense* is one of the possible meanings of a lexeme. For example, the lexeme *run* has many different senses, such as as "run in a race" and "run water in a sink". It is up to the linguist to decide whether two particular uses of a lexeme count as the same sense or different senses.

    description: The lexical category, part of speech, or morphosyntactic class for this Lexeme, optionally in multiple languages. If the current lexeme is an affix or other grammatical morpheme morpheme, this field should be used to describe the category that the morpheme attaches to. For example, the English verb suffix *‑s* would have this this property set to `verb`, and the English derivational suffix *‑ize* would have this property set to `noun`.

    description: If this lexeme is a derivational morpheme, this field indicates the type of lexical category, part of speech, or morphosyntactic class that is derived when this morpheme is applied. For example, the English derivational suffix *‑er* would have this property set to `noun`, since this suffix derives nouns from verbs. May be in multiple languages.

For precision's sake, it is recommended that examples be given for individual senses rather than the entire lexeme when possible.

    description: If this sense is a variant of another sense, a reference to the other sense should go here. For example, sometimes two speakers may use the same word with a slightly different set of senses. In American English, for instance, *Coke* is a specific brand of soda for most speakers, but a generic term for soda for other speakers. The generic sense would therefore be listed as a dialectal variant of the specific sense.

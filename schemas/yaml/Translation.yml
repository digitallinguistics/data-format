description: 'A translation of a piece of data in a language, optionally in multiple languages. For example, a translation might be written in both Spanish and English. Each key must be the abbreviation for an orthography (see the [Abbreviation](https://digitallinguistics.github.io/spec/schemas/Abbreviation.html) schema), and the value for that key is the translation of the data in that particular language and orthography. **Note:** The Translation does not have a `type` property (though it does have a `translationType` property).'

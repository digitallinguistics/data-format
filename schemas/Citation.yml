title:   Citation
type:    object

description: 'An object containing information about a citation to a bibliographic source. DLx recommends using Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON format for citations, but some implementations may choose to use other bibliographic tools and formats. As such, this schema does not enforce any particular format for Citation objects.'

$comment: The DLx tech stack uses a custom Citation object that stores precomputed bibliography entries and citation strings for the citation, so they don't have to be computed at runtime.

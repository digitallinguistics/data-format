  "description": "A *lexeme* is an abstract entity that represents all the various forms of a word. In DLx, a lexeme refers broadly to any bundle of related senses and forms, whether the item is an individual word, morpheme, idiom, etc.—anything that constitues a semantic unit. Examples of lexemes in English might include *be*, *run up* (a phrasal verb), and *‑ing*. A lexeme will typically have multiple *senses* or meanings, and those are listed in the `senses` property. It is up to the linguist to decide when two meanings are related, and therefore belong to the same lexeme, or when they belong to different lexemes.\n\nA lexeme often also has multiple base forms, such as suppletive forms, irregular forms, or morphologically-conditioned forms. For example, the lexeme *be* has the base forms *be*, *am*, *is*, etc. These are listed in the `forms` field. The `forms` field should **not** be used to list all the regularly-inflected forms of a word. In addition, individual base forms may have phonologically-conditioned allomorphs, and these are listed in the `allomorphs` field of the form.\n\nThe lexeme and its forms and senses may also have variations, such as dialectal and idiolectal variants, rapid speech variants, register-based variants, variations in meaning, or even spelling variants. These are listed in the `variants` fields.\n\nBy convention, one of the forms of a lexeme is typically chosen as a representative headword or *lemma*, and this is indicated by the `lemma` field. For example, the form *man* in English is typically used as the lemma/headword for the lexeme that includes the forms *man* and *men*. Note that the DLx Lexeme does **not** represent a lexical entry in a dictionary. Dictionaries typically list each base form of a lexeme as a separate lexical entry. The DLx Lexeme lists puts each of these lexical entries together in the `forms` field instead.",

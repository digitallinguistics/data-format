  "description": "A tag is a piece of metadata that can be applied to almost any DLx object. The tags object contains a set of tags for this resource as pairs of attributes and values. For example, a researcher might tag a suffix with the attribute `person`, and a value of `3`, to indicate that the particular suffix is 3rd Person. If no value is needed, the value may also be set to `true` or `false` or can be an empty string, however users are encouraged to use both attribute and value for every tag, since this helps identify the larger category that the tag value belongs to. Note: The Tags object does not have a `type` property.",

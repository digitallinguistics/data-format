  "description": "A translation of a piece of data in a language, optionally in multiple languages. For example, a translation might be written in both Spanish and English. Each key must be the abbreviation for a language (see the [Abbreviation](https://spec.digitallinguistics.github.io/schemas/Abbreviation.html) schema), and the value for that key is the translation of the data in that particular language. **Note:** The Translation does not have a `type` property.\n\nIf the translation is in only one language and that language is English, it may be represented as a simple string instead of an object. Thus instead of `gloss: { eng: \"M.SG\" }` you can simply write `gloss: \"M.SG\"`.",

title:   Lexeme
type:    object

description: "A *lexeme* or *lexical item* in DLx refers to any linguistic sign—that is, a form-meaning pairing or a construction. It is an abstract conceptual entity that represents all the various base forms of a sign and its associated meanings. In DLx, the lexical item might be a word, morpheme, idiom, etc. Examples of lexical items in English might include *be*, *run up* (a phrasal verb), and *‑ing* (a suffix). A lexical item will typically have multiple *senses* or meanings, and those are listed in the `senses` property. It is up to the linguist to decide when two meanings are related, and therefore belong to the same lexical item, or when they belong to different lexical items.\n\nA lexical item often also has multiple base forms, such as suppletive forms, irregular forms, or morphologically-conditioned forms. For example, the lexical item *be* has the base forms *be*, *am*, *is*, etc. These are listed in the `forms` field. The `forms` field should **not** be used to list all the regularly-inflected forms of a word. Individual base forms may have phonologically-conditioned allomorphs, and these are listed in the `allomorphs` field of the form.\n\nThe lexical item and its forms and senses may also have variations, such as dialectal and idiolectal variants, rapid speech variants, register-based variants, variations in meaning, or even spelling variants. These are listed in the `variants` fields.\n\nBy convention, one of the forms of a lexical item is typically chosen as a representative headword or *lemma*, and this is indicated by the `lemma` field. For example, the form *man* in English is typically used as the lemma/headword for the lexical item that includes the forms *man* and *men*. Note that the DLx lexical item does **not** represent a lexical entry in a dictionary. Dictionaries typically list each base form of a lexical item as a separate lexical entry. The DLx lexical item puts each of these lexical entries together in the `forms` field instead."

    description: The citation form of a lexeme is the form given when spoken in isolation, which may be different from its lemma form. For example, in Swahili the citation form of a verb is typically the infinitive, e.g. *kuandika* `to write`, even though *‑andika* is typically used as its lemma and dictionary headword. The citation form should include any relevant leading or trailing tokens (e.g. hyphens, equal signs).

Features may be written more than once, in different languages. For example, a morpheme may have the feature `case: accusative` (English) as well as `caso: acusativo` (Spanish). Note that the `features` property is available at both the Lexeme and Forms levels. This is because the locus of some features varies from language to language.'

    type:        object
    description: 'A *lemma* is the form of a lexeme conventionally used to represent that lexeme. It is mostly an organizational convenience—a useful way to refer to a lexical item without having to list all its forms every time. The choice of lemma depends on the project, person, language, field of study, etc. It is often (but not always) used as the headword in dictionary entries. Possible choices for the lemma include: the citation form (examples of which might be the infinitive or the third person singular perfective); one of the base forms (often the stem in the singular); the underlying representation; or others. For example, the form *be* is typically used as the lemma form of the English verb forms *am*, *are*, *is*, etc., even though the citation form is typically given in the infinitive as *to be*. The DLx Lemma object contains information about the lemma and how it should be displayed. Lemmas may be represented in multiple orthographies. They should include any relevant leading or trailing tokens (e.g. hyphens, equal signs).'

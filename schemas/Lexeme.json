  "description": "A *lexeme* is the set of all forms that share the same meaning. A lexeme is used broadly by DLx to refer to any collection of related senses and forms, whether the item is an individual word, a morpheme, or even a fully-inflected phrase. In other words, DLx lexeme objects can be used to describe anything that constitutes a lexical unit or construction. A lexeme will often have multiple *senses* or meanings, and those are listed in the `senses` field. It is up to the linguist to decide when two meanings are related, and therefore part of the same lexeme, or when they belong in different lexemes. A lexeme will also often have multiple variants. For example, the lexeme `run` in English has two base forms: `run` and `ran`. The `run` form is listed as the headword or *lemma*, and `ran` is listed as a past tense variant. The `variants` field should *not* be used to list all the inflectional forms of a Lexeme.",

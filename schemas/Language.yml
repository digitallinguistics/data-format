description: DLx uses the term *language* broadly to refer to any speech variety—whether a language, dialect, idiolect, or even a historical variety. The same schema is also used for language families. The DLx `Language` object groups together all the information about the language, including writing systems, its phonological inventory, and metadata (e.g. names and language codes).

For example, Spanish might have an array of objects for Indo-European, Romance, and Ibero-Romance in that order. In practice, each Database Reference here will likely contain only a few necessary properties, such as `name` and `glottocode`, potentially among others. For language isolates, sign languages, artificial languages, or other varieties whose classification is not straightforward, use a Language object with the appropriate name instead, such as `Isolate` or `Sign Language`.

          text: This is the traditional name used for the Chitimacha language by the Chitimacha people themselves. It most likely derives from _siit‑_ 'body of water' + _‑ma_ pluractional + _‑x_ topic marker, meaning 'people of the waters'. This is most likely a reference to the fact that the Chitimacha people live deep in the bayou waterways of Louisiana.

  - name: Shangaji
    description:
      eng: Shangaji is spoken in three small villages in the Nampula province of Mozambique. The deposit focuses on the variant spoken in Naatthembo village, just west of the Sangage peninsula which begins north of Angoche town. Naatthembo has more or less 4000 inhabitants and represents the major Shangaji speaking centre with the two other locations; Nakonya village and the Likookha area in Mogincual adding more or less 500 and 700 speakers to this number of speakers which is in decline due to a lack of intergenerational language transfer. Nthamala village, some 10 km away from Naatthembo, no longer has Shangaji speakers because of a complete shift to the regional lingua franca Makhuwa (Enlai). The Shangaji deposit thus responds to an urgent documentation need, also because the language is one of four coastal languages that are believed to bear traces of the Swahili world which once stretched from Somalia to the south of Mozambique.

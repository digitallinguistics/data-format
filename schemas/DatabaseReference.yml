title:   Database Reference

description: 'A reference to an item in a database. The value of the Database Reference will depend on your database model. In relational databases, this will probably be a unique ID, formatted as a string or integer. For document databases, this might be an entire embedded object, or a partially embededed object containing only a key subset of fields. For document databases, this may mean that you embed the entire object every time. (This type of redundancy is often appropriate for document databases.) In this case, the Database Reference is not really referencing / pointing to any separate object at all. It simply *is* the referenced data. For example, rather than referencing a separate Person object stored in the database, you could simply embed all the information about that Person within that field.'

examples:

  # A unique string ID.
  - 888a2165-9e85-483a-9c39-26d6a501ad66

  # A unique numeric ID.
  - 93487

  # A partially-embedded Person object.
  - id:           0e2233d8-e51a-4332-9915-9f1baed3578c

title:   Base Form
type:    object

description: The *base forms* of a lexeme are the minimal set of forms needed to determine the full set of inflectional possibilities of a lexeme. In the simplest case, you will often only need to list one form (typically the stem, or a transcription of the affix). Base forms might include suppletive forms, irregular forms, or morphologically-conditioned forms. For example, the lexeme *be* has the base forms *be*, *am*, *is*, etc., while the lexeme *man* has the base forms *man* and *men*. A base form does **not** refer to a regularly-inflected, predictable form like *being* or *cats*. Principal parts of verbs in Latin are another example of base forms, since they are the minimal set of forms that someone must know to determine all the inflectional possibilities of a verb.

properties:

  abstract:
    title:       Abstract
    type:        boolean
    description: A Boolean (`true/false`) field used to indicate if this form is an abstract/underlying form. If a form is an underlying representation, the value should be `true`. If the form is a surface realization, the value should be `false` (or may be omitted; a value of `false` is assumed by default). This is useful for tools that wish to display abstract forms between some type of brackets or slashes.

  features:
    title:       Features

Each property should be the name of a feature type (e.g. `case`, `person`, `number`, `gender`, `nounClass`, etc.), and its value should be the value for that feature, as a string (e.g. `nominative`, `1`, `singular`, `masculine`, etc.). Features may be written more than once, in different languages. For example, a morpheme may have the feature `case: accusative` (English) as well as `caso: acusativo` (Spanish). Note that the `features` property is available at both the Lexeme and Forms levels. This is because the locus of some features varies from language to language.'

    $ref:        https://schemas.digitallinguistics.io/DatabaseReference.json

    title:       Phonological Class
    $ref:        https://schemas.digitallinguistics.io/Category.json
    description: The phonological class of this form. This is useful when the morphophonological behavior of a form is lexically specified and/or unpredictable. For example, some stems in Plains Cree palatalize in certain contexts, while other stems do not. Which stem adheres to which behavior is unpredictable. The phonological class field allows you to specify the phonological behavior of individual items in such cases.

  reconstructed:
    title:       Reconstructed
    type:        boolean
    default:     false
    description: Whether the form is a reconstructed (unattested) form. Note that some historically reconstructed forms are also attested in the actual historical record. In this case, you may want to set the value of this property to `false`. User interfaces will typically display reconstructed forms with a leading asterisk, following standard convention in historical linguistics.

    title:       Underlying Form / Representation
    $ref:        https://schemas.digitallinguistics.io/Transcription.json
    description: The underlying form/representation for this base form. Use of this field typically isn't necessary since base forms tend to be represented in their underlying form anyway. This field can however be useful for transcribing a base form using archiphonemes or other deep phonological representations of the form.

    title:       Usages
    type:        array

  variants:

    description: A list of variants of this this form. This field should be used for dialectal and idiolectal variants, rapid and careful speech variants, register-based variants, spelling variants, pronunciation variants, morphological variants, etc. It should not be used for phonologically-conditioned variants. Use the `allomorphs` field for that instead. Each variant should have its `variantType` property specified.

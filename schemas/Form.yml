title:   Base Form
type:    object

description: The *base forms* of a lexeme are the minimal set of forms needed to determine the full set of inflectional possibilities of a lexeme. These include suppletive forms, irregular forms, or morphologically-conditioned forms. For example, the lexeme *be* has the base forms *be*, *am*, *is*, etc., while the lexeme *man* has the base forms *man* and *men*. A base form does **not** refer to a regularly-inflected, predictable form like *being* or *cats*. Principal parts of verbs in Latin are another example of base forms, since they are the minimal set of forms that someone must know to determine all the inflectional possibilities of a verb.

  abstract:
    title:       Abstract
    type:        boolean
    description: A Boolean (`true/false`) field used to indicate if a LexemeForm is an abstract/underlying form. If a form is an underlying representation, the value should be `true`. If the form is a surface realization, the value should be `false` (or may be omitted; a value of `false` is assumed by default). This is useful for tools that wish to display abstract forms between some type of brackets or slashes.
